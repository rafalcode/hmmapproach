Exploring HMM algorithms through simple C code implementations

# Start: CpG island detection
We start by looking at a famous example, the detection of CpG islands in DNA sequences. HMMs are particularly intensively used in bioinformatics
especially in gene and feature prediction, so they are pretty much a prerequisite subject to study. Durbin et al have a nice example in their textbook, and here is some simple C code implementing it.
